# Background
In the year IC 2480, endless waves of Greenskins pouring from the Grey Mountains.  
Bretonnia forces barely hold out against the Greenskins. Not enough manpower to defend against such an invasion themselves, and the Greenskins took over the region in The Wasteland. Feramand, the leader of the Bretonnia, has decided to hire 7 Ogre mercenaries and send them to the Wasteland to help Bretonnian forces against the Greenskins.  
The war waged on for months and months, many knights and peasants had died in the battle, but the 7 mercenaries finally made a breakthrough and defeated the Greenskins.  
Because of the valiant effort of the 7 mercenaries, Feramand rewarded them to join the Bretonnia; they were given the title of the 'Knights of Round Belly'.
The mercenaries were given task to quest around the world to smite evils lurking on Bretonnia frontiers and her colonies. Or maybe this was just a plan to get rid of them...   

*Feramand = Louen Leounceur's predecessor.   

# Mod guide
- There are 6 ogre paladins and 1 ogre lord scattered on the old world, keep in mind they're mortal and can permanently die if they never sipped from the Grail (Yes, grail ogres are insanely strong).  
- Each ogre will take 6 peasant slots and may severe your economy, play your campaign slowly, build farms, and make sure to unlock their skills in the skill tree to mitigate this.  
- Some ogres can only spawn once and only at specific locations on the map.
- If you dismiss an ogre, they will be gone for good. So, it's a good idea to strengthen your economy before facing this dilemma :)

# Common issue
- Q: The ogres have no sound in campaign
- A: You have to install audio pack as in Warhammer 2 there's no voice over for ogres in the campaign map
- Q: Sometimes peasant slots says 20/7 (or similar) but the game tooltip told my peasants quota is still enough?
- A: Click at any unit in the campaign map to update the peasant slot UI.
- Q: I want to spawn them instant!
- A: Edit the mod pack, go to campaign script and set DEBUG to true before PJ_LOADFILE

# Mod compatibility
Because of how strong these ogres in late game, I don't really need to balance it for SFO or CTT.   
Multiplayer is untested. But there is some netcode built into it, still need someone else to test it.   

**IMPORTANT: It is recommended to use the mod with fresh, new campaign**   

# Is this lore accurate?  
For me, Yes :)
